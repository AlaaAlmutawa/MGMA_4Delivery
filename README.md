This repository focuses on processing real-world graphs, specifically the web-Google dataset from Stanford. It includes implementations of various algorithms for community detection and influence maximization.

**Dataset**: 
The dataset used in this project is the web-Google graph from Stanford, providing a real-world scenario for testing and experimentation.

**Algorithms**:
  1. Community Detection
     
      a. Heuristic - Louvain Algorithm: The Louvain algorithm is implemented for heuristic-based community detection, offering an efficient approach to uncovering community structures in the graph.

       b. ML-based - Spectral Clustering: Spectral clustering is utilized for community detection using machine learning techniques, providing an alternative perspective to uncovering graph communities.

  3. Influence Maximization

     a. Heuristic - Independent Cascading: The Independent Cascading model is implemented for heuristic-based influence maximization, exploring the propagation of influence in the graph.

     b. ML-based - To be done
